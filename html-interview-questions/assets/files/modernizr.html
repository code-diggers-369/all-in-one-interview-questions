      /**
         Modernizr tests which native CSS3 and HTML5 features are available in the current UA 
         and makes the results available to you in two ways: as properties on a global Modernizr 
         object, and as classes on the <html> element. This information allows you to progressively 
         enhance your pages with a granular level of control over the experience.
