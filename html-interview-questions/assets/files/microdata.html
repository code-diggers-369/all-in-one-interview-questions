        Microdata is a standardized way to provide additional semantics in web pages.

        Search engines benefit greatly from direct access to this structured data because 
        it allows search engines to understand the information on web pages and provide more 
        relevant results to users.

        At a high level, microdata consists of a group of name-value pairs
        1) itemscope:- To create an item
        2) itemprop:- To add a property to an item
    -->
    <div itemscope>
      <p>My name is <span itemprop="name">Elizabeth</span>.</p>
    </div>

    <div itemscope>
      <p>My name is <span itemprop="name">Daniel</span>.</p>
    </div>
  </body>
