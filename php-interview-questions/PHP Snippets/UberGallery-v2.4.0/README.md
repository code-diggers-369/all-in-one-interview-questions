Troubleshooting
---------------
If you're having issues with UberGallery here are a few troubleshooting tips:

  * Verify that you have PHP 5.2 or later installed.  You can verify your PHP version by running:

    ```
    php --version
    ```

  * Make sure you have the latest version of UberGallery installed.  You can always find the latest
    version at <http://www.ubergallery.net/#download>

  * Replace your `galleryConfig.ini` with `sample.galleryConfig.ini` to ensure proper configuration:

    ```
    rm resources/galleryConfig.ini
    cp resource/sample.galleryConfig.ini resources/galleryConfig.ini
    ```

  * Clear your cache and make sure the directory is writable by the web server:

    ```
    rm -f resources/cache/*
    chmod 777 resources/cache
    ```

  * Enable debugging by setting the `enable_debugging` option in `resources/galleryConfig.ini` to
    `true`, try loading your gallery in a web browser then inspect the debug.log file in your cache
    directory for any errors.
