Alhambra Hotel built in the early 1840's for lodging purposes, represents one of the last landmarks of the Pre-Victorian Period Set in Kings Cross, an area which was once a village called Battle Bridge. It is surrounded with historical landmarks, such as the famous Kings Cross Train Station built in 1851 which at the time was the largest Railway Station in England. 

Over the last 50 years The Alhambra Hotel in King's Cross London, has established itself as the premier budget Bed and Breakfast (B&amp;B) within the King's Cross / St. Pancras area. 

The Alhambra Hotel offers comfortable refurbished rooms, with a complimentary tea and coffee making facilities in every room, a full English or Continental Breakfast and WiFi for a very affordable / cheap price. 

The Alhambra Hotel has been run by the Valoti family for over half a century, originally by Francesco and Martine and now also aided by their daughter and son-in-law Sonia and Bruno. 

During this period the hotel has hosted guests who wanted to see local sites such as the British Museum and British Library or take advantage of the fantastic public transport links. This has been added to with the opening of the new St. Pancras Eurostar Station which is very near and easily within walking distance. 

When seen as an overall package the combination of affordable and comfortable rooms, with a now world famous breakfast cooked (by the Owner himself!), free WiFi and amazing location, makes the Alhambra Hotel the obvious choice of accommodation within the Kings Cross / St Pancras area.</Text></Description><Description><Language>en</Language><Type>SurroundingArea</Type><Text>The Hotel is merely a 2 minute walk away from Kings Cross underground and St. Pancras train stations and the new Eurostar Terminal. Euston Station is only a 5 minute walk away too. The whole area is well served by buses and parking is available nearby at very reasonable rates. 
These days Kings Cross is a very cosmopolitan area with many restaurants and nearby shops, such as the famous chapel market. The new eurostar terminal is only about 2 minutes walk from the hotel.

The Alhambra Hotel which has grown from its original single building site, is now be housed over 2 facing buildings on Argyle Street. Argyle Street is off the famous Euston Road and opposite Kings Cross and St. Pancras Stations.</Text></Description><Description><Language>en</Language><Type>RoomTypes</Type><Text>Single Room  - Ensuite - Room with Shower and Toilet INSIDE the Room.
