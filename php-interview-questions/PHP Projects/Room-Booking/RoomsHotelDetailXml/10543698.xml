The Marriott Grand Chateau, located next door to The Carriage House, has begun new construction on two towers. The contractors do begin work as early as 5:00am, Monday through Friday. In addition, some work may be done in the overnight hours from 11:00pm to 5:00am. Unfortunately, the noise and work hours are out of the control of The Carriage House.  The work is anticipated to continue through 2014.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
