The apartments are ideally located within walking distance of Bristol Temple Meads train station and all the city centre attractions. The apartment block has been converted from the site of a former Brewery, originally Georges Brewery and more recently, Courage, which was closed in 1999. You will find some beautiful stone walls and fantastic architecture from the original building still in place today. Staying with Cleyro offers you so much more, you can expect a fully fitted designer kitchen, including an oven, microwave and fridge freezer, kettle and toaster.

It was from here that the city of Bristol was first formed back in Saxon times as Brycgstow, meaning 'place of the bridge'. The original Saxon bridge would have been timber-built, but Bristol grew to become a major port, in the 1240s Bristol followed London in replacing its bridge in stone. Today the bridge is listed as a Grade 2 listed building.</Text></Description><Description><Language>en</Language><Type>RoomTypes</Type><Text>Deluxe Apartment - Our one bedroom deluxe apartments offer contemporary living in the heart of Bristol.
