This is a place where the tradition of the aloha spirit dwells and guests will always feel welcome as they enjoy the intimate, friendly atmosphere. Kihei's sunny shoreline is the setting for Leinaala. Only twenty minutes drive from Kahului Airport, this oceanfront property is convenient to shopping, banks and a post office. Also in the area are fine restaurants and championship-caliber golf. Each of the condominium units enjoys stunning views of the Pacific Ocean and the West Maui Mountains. The modern conveniences are here, from air-conditioning, to cable television, to fully appointed kitchens. Leinaala offers many recreational opportunities: swimming in the pool, tennis, fishing, windsurfing, beach combing, and seasonal whale watching. Or, some guest just prefer to relax on the lanai, entertained by another impressive Maui sunset as seen from their piece of paradise. 
**Minimum 4-night stay is required or a cleaning fee will be needed at check-out**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that for the dates September 7 - 30, 2010, the elevator will be shut down at this property, and guests will need to use the stairs during this time.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></Description><Description><Language>en</Language><Type>RoomTypes</Type><Text>Two Bedroom Ocean Front - This condominiums includes queen bed, twin beds, queen hide a bed sofa.
