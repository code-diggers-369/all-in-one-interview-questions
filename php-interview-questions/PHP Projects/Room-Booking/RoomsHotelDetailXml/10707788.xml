A carved, stone castle, surrounded by age-old olive groves and vineyards, gorges and Byzantine churches. 
The old manor of the Loupassi family was restored and expanded with a great zest, resulting in a rambling form which consists of steps, arches and lanes with courtyards. All the above combined with its prime location make up a unique place. 
Guest may choose from royal suites, two-storey rooms with a fireplace or traditional attic rooms for your accommodation and travel to the past.</Text></Description><Description><Language>en</Language><Type>SurroundingArea</Type><Text>The historic Palazzo is located 30 kilometres to the west of the city of Chania, in the hamlet of Vasilopoulo-Kolymvari of Chania, Crete.</Text></Description><Rating><System>Stars</System><Score>50</Score><Description>Five star</Description></Rating><Rank>1</Rank></HotelElement>
