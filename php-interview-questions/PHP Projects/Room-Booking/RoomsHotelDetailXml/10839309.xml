Homewood Park is a very gracious country house hotel near Bath and one of the loveliest country house hotels in the West Country. Set in beautiful countryside it is only six miles from Bath and only 30 minutes from the M4. Homewood Park has received many accolades and much praise for the service and facilities provided and guests always appreciate the warm welcoming and relaxing atmosphere. Indeed many tell us its their ideal home in the country Homewood Park Luxury Country House Hotel Hinton Charterhouse Near Bath.
Guests always enjoy a stroll in the ten acres of beautiful gardens which under the supervision of Steven Hargreaves were awarded 1st prize in the actively contested Bath in Bloom competition in 1998 1999 and 2000 2005 creating a wonderfully attractive and peaceful environment for the hotel and restaurant. Although the main part of the building is Georgian with some Victorian additions the foundations of the original building date from the 13th C when we believe the house belonged to the Abbot of the nearby Carthusian Priory. The Priory may be seen in the direction of Hinton Charterhouse village across the A36.
The drawing room study and bar are furnished to ensure guests enjoy comfort and unassuming luxury by the log fires during the winter months. For the warmer months of the year the award winning gardens offer privacy and interest.</Text></Description><Description><Language>en</Language><Type>SurroundingArea</Type><Text>Rural</Text></Description><Description><Language>en</Language><Type>RoomTypes</Type><Text>Garden Suite - Brand New Garden Suites
