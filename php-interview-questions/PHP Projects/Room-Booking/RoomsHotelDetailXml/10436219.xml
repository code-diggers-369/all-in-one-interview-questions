Hotel Villa di Piazzano is a manor house of the 1400s located in the countryside just outside the town of Cortona, a town on the border between Tuscany and Umbria made famous by the American writer Frances Mayes with her book and later the movie, Under the Tuscan Sun. An Italian-Australian family acquired the Villa some years ago with a tradition in hotels, the Wimpole family, which carefully transformed the Villa into an exclusive hotel, with that warm and intimate atmosphere that only a family run property can provide. The Villa is surrounded by a garden of 1 hectare, with a beautiful formal Italian garden, a spectacular entrance with a cypress lined driveway, a large swimming pool and private parking for guests.  The menu of the restaurant changes with the seasons and offers dishes, which are traditional of this region, based on local and genuine products.  The hotel also has a bar facility which is transferred under the shaded terrace in the summer months.
The Villa is classified as a Historical Residence and offers a warm and elegant atmosphere for the discerning traveler. The hotel amenities are: airport transfer (surcharge), baby sitting (surcharge), banquet facilities, bar, concierge, dry cleaning, Internet access-wireless, laundry service, library, lift/elevator, lobby, non-smoking rooms, reception, room service (limited hours), safe deposit box, swimming pool-outdoor, air-conditioned public areas, complimentary newspaper in lobby, computer rental, restaurant. Breakfat included.</Text></Description><Description><Language>en</Language><Type>SurroundingArea</Type><Text>From Florence to Rome A1 autostrada exit at Bettolle-Valdichiana. After the tollbooth follow the signs for Cortona, (straight accross the round about). You will find yourself on a motorway heading for Perugia. Take the Castiglion del Lago exit (do not take the Cortona exit) and turn right towards Cortona. Pass the towns of Terontola and then Riccio, afterwhich turn right for Ossaia. Follow the road to the very end and turn right towards Mercatale. After approx. 4 km, at the end of the town of Pergo, turn right for Villa di Piazzano (road sign). Follow the main country road - the Villa is located at the very end of the cypress tree lined road. We highly recommend you arrive while there is still daylight and equip yourselves with a map of the area.  From its altitude of 600 m., Cortona dominates over an incomparable panorama, which sweeps through to the distant Mount Amiata and Lake Trasimeno. The town has a medieval feel with elegant renaissance buildings</Text></Description><Description><Language>en</Language><Type>RoomTypes</Type><Text>Double Classic Single Use - The room offers one double bed or one twin beds with cable/satellite TV, color TV, ensuite/private bathroom, hairdryer, housekeeping, bidet, extra towels, linen, beddings, heating, Internet access (high speed-wireless), iron/ironing board (on request), laundry service, mini bar, non-smoking rooms, wake-up calls, window opens, turndown service, room service (limited hours), telephone (direct-dial), climate control, complimentary toiletries, complimentary newspaper, cribs available, desk.
