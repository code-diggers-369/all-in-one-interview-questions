<p><strong>Liability</strong><br />
Subject to the provisions contained in the following paragraph and irrespective of legal grounds, Online Auction is liable only for damages resulting from the intentional misconduct or gross negligence of Online Auction, its legal representatives, employees or authorized agents.</p>
<p>
For damages resulting from the gross negligence of Online Auction or its Agents, liability is limited to damages commonly associated with the agreement in question.
